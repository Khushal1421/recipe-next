const data= await response.json(); // it was giving error recipes.map is not a function cuz Spoonacular API wraps Array in {"recipes:[]"} as iswith JSON. So has to change it
        return data.recipes;
REMEMBER IT IN FUTURE when  using API's that u have to parse API in order to get data acc. to ur liking (i.e. extract formatted data)
urlsearchparams IMP for dealing with params (like I am doing for complexSearch API)

 where reassigning never happens, use const. Else will give error during deployment
